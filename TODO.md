# TODO (near-term)
- [ ] Icons: ensure images appear on list reliably (CG markets, chunking, fallback).
- [ ] Offline cache: Room-backed descriptions with TTL (30 days) + strip HTML.
- [ ] Rate-limiting: exponential backoff; cache read on failure.
- [ ] Background sync: optional WorkManager job to refresh popular tokens.
- [ ] Error UX: show last cached + small "updated X days ago".
