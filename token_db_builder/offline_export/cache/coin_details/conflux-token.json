Users can use CFX to participate in governance votes, stake their tokens to earn network interest, or pay for the network's storage and transaction fees.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere can I buy the Conflux token (CFX)?\r\nCFX is supported across leading exchanges such as Binance, KuCoin, OKEX, Gate, and MEXC\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere can I stake the Conflux token (CFX)? \r\nCFX can be staked at any of the Staking Pools operated by the Conflux community.
